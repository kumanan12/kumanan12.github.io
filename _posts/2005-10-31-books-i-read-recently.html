<div>There is so much going on in the open source world. lots of tools/technologies have sprung up in the past few years. If someone wants to get it into&nbsp;&nbsp;java platform, there are a host of technologies that one have to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;some of the hot technologies are struts, JSF, spring. Apart from these, one have to learn to develop applications in commercial/open source&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Servers. BEA's Weblogic, IBM's Websphere, JBOSS are some of the popular application Servers.  <br><br>I read a couple of books recently. They were interesting and easy to understand. Yes. Its the <em>Head First Series.&nbsp; </em>I bought 3 books from the series.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <ol> <li>&nbsp;Head First Java</li> <li>Head First Servlets and JSP.</li> <li>Head First EJB.</li></ol> <div>Even though I am fundamentally very good in the java language,&nbsp; the Head First Java book was very good. I really like the authors approach to teaching. I would suggest to&nbsp;read these books</div> <div>This really helped me.&nbsp; I go to Barnes and Nobles to check whether the books are&nbsp; worth buying. Why dont you try !!!&nbsp; </div> <div>&nbsp;Have fun&nbsp; Reading !!!</div>
