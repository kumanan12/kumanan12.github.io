Though I have been working the Software Industry for over 8 years, I am yet to become an architect.  I have interacted with many architects in my previous assignments. Each one of them had different background,different academic qualifications but one thing was common. That was <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXPERIENCE</span> . I am sure many of you would wondering what it takes to be an Architect. These are following responsibilities of an Architect.  This is not all inclusive.<br /><ol><li>Support business visioning and scoping activities</li><li>Translate between business and IT requirements</li><li>communicate with stakeholders both within business and IT</li><li>Weigh different interests</li><li>Determine solution alternatives</li><li>Create viable and feasible design</li><li>Choose solutions</li><li>Manage quality</li><li>Manage Complexity</li><li>Mitigate Risks</li><li>Communicate</li></ol>I got these points from the Microsoft Architcture Journal. One more interesting website to note. It is the  <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/skyscrapr/default.aspx">Skyscrapr.</a>  This is from Microsoft. Lots of articles are there.  Have fun....
