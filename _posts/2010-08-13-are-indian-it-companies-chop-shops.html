Related links about the comments are<br /><br /><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/08/trade_1">Chop shop?</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_41/b4150034732629.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">America's High-tech Sweatshops</span>.</a><br /><br />My Opinion about the articles and the comment is.<br /><br />They are absolutely true. Being an Indian and having lived in the US for 10 years, I have seen and worked with lot of friends and co workers who were working for one of the so called top companies in India.  The normal day start like this.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">These guys come to work at the client side in the day as rest of us. But the day does not end for them when they reach home. Immediately after 9 p.m, they will be having an off shore call with their counter parts in India. The call will go on until 1 a.m. This poor guy would have only a few hours of sleep and then gets ready for work the next day and deal with the onsite Manager.</span><br /><br />This is considered OK if this happens once a week. But this happens almost every day including the weekends.  Just because these guys were a select few out of a 50 thousand employees and were sent to US for on-site opportunity, their Managers in India and On-site have all the rights to disturb them even in the middle of the night...  Why?  THEY ARE PAID IN DOLLARS.  Don't assume that they are paid a hefty salary. Its not even the minimum salary. There have been multiple instances that Indian companies like Cognizant Technologies and Patni computers have been fined by the Labor department for not giving minimum wages.  Are they practicing the American Labor Laws. Absolutely no.<br /><br />If what I am saying is true, one may think, why nobody has complained to the Labor department, because they are all bonded in the name of Visa and a agreement signed by these guys before leaving India.  They will threaten the employees with law suits even though it is not valid in many instances.<br /><br />The typical employee working in these kind of companies work on an average 60-65 hours a week.  Even with all these difficulties, these guys manage to save some money and send it back home.<br /><br />There is nobody to fight for the Indian IT worker both here and in India. I am coining a new term for the Indian IT workers. They are the new <span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Bluish-White Collar worker</span>.<br />Why don't the media agencies interview me? I am not joking here. I can talk for hours about this.<br /><br />What will happen to these workers 10 years from now?<br /><br />India has a huge workforce which will work against these guys.  These guys are not supermen. They are also ordinary human beings. These guys will be worn out by then like a sugar cane after the juice has been extracted. The recession has already taught a lesson to many of the Indian software engineers. Hiring and Firing happens in India too.
