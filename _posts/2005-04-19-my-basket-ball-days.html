I started playing basket ball when I was in 4th grade. Basket ball was everything to me until I realised that sports in India will not take you to a high level either monetarily or socially. But I had a lot of fun in those days that I will never regret in my life about not having a very good childhood. Being a sportsman gives a lot of skills to be successful in life. You will become competitive, learn to accept failure, prepare to become strong, become famous in school/college and the list will go on .........<br /><br />In my small town chengalpattu, near Chennai,India , most of the people either played basket ball or knew basket ball. Cas there were only few games played at the local school( st. Josephs)<br /><br />I learnt very quickly and started playing with bigger boys who were 3 years older than me. I got selected for the state team in Under 13 age group when I was sixth grade. I felt like I got selected to play for the Olympics. I still remember my first vist outside the state. We went to Jamshedpur, Bihar. When I went to the National Championship, all the guys were BIG and I was so little. I was'nt even scared at all.<br />The first lesson I learned in sports is "Never fear" . I 'll consider my opponent as nothing, even he is a very good and strong player. Otherwise you will not get confidence. I did'nt get a chance to play in the court because I was not experienced and very tiny. Overall I liked the tour.<br />When I came back from that tour, All I saw was success for years. I got lots of friends from all over the state. I became famous in school. i still remember my tamil teacher telling about me to the sixth grade students that I bring lots of Trophies to school and make the school proud.<br />Overall I represented my state Tamilnadu for 14 times and represnted my University 3 times.That was great achivement to me. All went well until I joined college. I got selected for B.E in the famous Coimbatore Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, India through sports quota. The college was very good except it did'nt have a good basket ball team. I thought I could go n play with my friends in other colleges and improve my game. But that did'nt happen. But I still played well in the tournaments. My performance slowly started to decline. I did'nt realise. When I came into the final year, I realised that I have to get a job thru sports. So I met a very famous coach Mr.Kamalagar Rao to get training from him. I would say that the training he gave me in 4 months was the best in my life.He was a very good mentor too. He gave lots and lots of live examples. Then with a very good training I graduated from CIT and started looking for a job in govt. The scenario was'nt that good. In 1995 I went to my first job selection in chennai for a central govt job.<br />With all my skills and training, I played a terrible game and it looked like I was a very amateur player there. I slipped on the ground so mant times. Overall I gave a lousy performance. That was the single major blow in my whole life. I felt so bad and decided immediately to quit basket ball. But my dad gave me very good advice and moral support. He helped me to go the next job selection. There I performed very well and went up to the final round and got rejected.<br /><br />Then I decided to quit basket ball and started thinking about my next move with my friends in pondicherry, India.<br /><br />I would never forget the following people in my basket ball life<br />1. Benjamin ( without him, I would'nt have achieved anything in life)<br />2. Raja annan, Chengalpattu, India<br />3. Valluvan, My school physical Director<br />4. Kamalakar Rao<br /><br />I cannot write all my friends name here. Its a very big list.<br /><br />My favourite basket ball player in India is Tony leslie. He is from chengalpattu, too.
