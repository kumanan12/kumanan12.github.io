<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><br />Before I say why India should stop going after nuclear technology, I would like to share a story from Japan.<br />Japan's bullet train has been in service since 1964 running at an maximum speed of 240-300 kmph (149-186 mph) spanning a distance of 2387 KM (1483 miles). It is one of the most advanced transportation system in the world. It also has an ultimate standard of safety which has set the worldwide standard for excellence. Not even a single passenger has died as a result of accident.<br /><br />When the massive 9.0 magnitude earth quake hit Japan in Mar 2011, The train was carrying 10000 passengers running at an average speed of 270 kmph (170 mph). Not a single train derailed and not a life was lost. &nbsp;This was the result of unique safety system developed over the years and deployed over the entire network.<br /><br />When an earthquake occurs, the primary P-waves were almost un-noticeable to human beings, may arrive a minute or so before the secondary S-waves. If one of the hundreds of railway seismometers detect these P-waves, it sends message to the substations supplying electricity to the networks which causes the bullet trains to apply emergency brakes as soon as a power cut is detected. &nbsp;By the time the more powerful S-waves arrive, the trains slowed to a much safer speed, though it may take 1.5 KM from the application of the brakes until the train reaches stand-still depending on the speed of the train when the power was cut and the brakes applied.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">What does this mean to India?&nbsp;</span><br /><br />We have been constantly reading in the news about train accidents for so many years. It may be human error or technical error. I just did a search of Indian railways accidents and Wikipedia has an detailed record of &nbsp;accidents for the last 30 years. You can check this link&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_rail_incidents">List of Indian rail incidents.</a>&nbsp; Just for this year alone, we had 11 incidents. &nbsp;With such a poor track record for safety, how can the&nbsp;government&nbsp;justify setting up a nuclear power plant when developed countries are going away from nuclear energy and looking for alternative&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sources like solar, wind, algae, etc. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">What the critics would say?</span><br />India is facing a huge energy crisis both at the industrial and consumer level. We had a massive grid failure last year. More than 300,000 people in India are still with out electricity. People who already have access to electricity face an average 10 hours of power cuts everyday.. &nbsp;Nuclear energy is cheap and cost effective. &nbsp;All&nbsp;these&nbsp;points are valid. I am not denying that. <br /><br /><br />The damage caused by nuclear accidents, if any would be much much more than the railway accidents that we have seen so far. India will see that impact for decades in future . Do we want to go for nuclear energy at the cost of these lives. Given the poor track record of safety and &nbsp;value for human life, If I were the PM, I would be against NUCLEAR POWER at any cost.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">So what should India do?</span><br /><br />I would like to hear about this from the comments of this blog. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Note: The Japan story was taken from Business week magazine Oct 22-28 2012.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
