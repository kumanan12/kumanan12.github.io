<div style="text-align: justify;">Having worked in the U.S for six years, I just returned to India to get my VISA stamped.Unfortunately I got my visa appointment only after six months. I took an independent work with a company in the US and hired a couple of programmers. Since I was working independently, I just followed the US work culture. Eight hour job and weekend off. The software development work is never ending. You have to keep on working. By pacing yourself for eight hours a day and having enough time to go to gym and spend time with your family, you can be very productive.<br /></div><br />This happened for six months. The project was over. I got my visa stamped too. I couldn't got back to US immediately due to personal reasons. So I took up a job with Birlasoft Ltd as Project leader. It is a CMM level 5 company. I immediately felt the pressure. 75% of the company <span style="font-weight: bold;">stay </span>in the work place for more than 11 hours. People just stay late even if they dont have any work to do. If you come to work at 9 AM and leave by 6 PM, your manager may ask <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">why are you leaving early??</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">People just stay for fear or impress their PM/PL.  Managers usually come around 10.30 A.M and leave by 9 PM.  </span><br /><br />Overall the net effect is productivity is reduced a lot and nothing worked as per plan. <blockquote style="color: rgb(255, 153, 102); font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One more interesting thing to note is "One project manager's qualification is B.com (distance learning) .</span></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> How come a company can hire a candidate like this to manage a team of technical people. There was a lot of emotional talk going on in that team.<br /><br />I made sure that none of my team members stay late unnecessarily.  We as a team went out for trip to ooty and discussed a lot about each others problems.<br /><br />I dont know whether this is the trend in Birlasoft only or everywhere. If this trend continues, employees will wear out very soon.<br /><br />Hope you dont do the same thing in your office. <br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Work smart is the slogan for software developers</span>
