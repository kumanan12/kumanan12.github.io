<div style="text-align: justify;">I recently joined as a .NET consultant in Boston with mercer.com. My commute was around 40 miles one way which will take at least an hour to reach my work place. My new <span class="misspell" charindex="227" suggestions="pod,Izod,ipso,oped,ID">ipod</span> somehow stopped working. So I  bought a <span class="misspell" charindex="270" suggestions="Niki,Nookie,Nook,Nicki,Nikki">Nokia</span> 5300 mobile which had  1GB of memory. I remember bookmarking a <span class="misspell" charindex="338" suggestions="pod casting,pod-casting,podcast,outcasting,typecasting">podcasting</span>  site for .NET(<a href="http://polymorphicpodcast.com/" charindex="363">http://polymorphicpodcast.com</a><a charindex="392">)  at</a>  my social bookmarking site(<a href="http://del.icio.us/kumanan12" charindex="424">http://del.icio.us/kumanan12</a>). Just went to that site and  downloaded a couple of podcasts to my <span class="misspell" charindex="520" suggestions="Niki,nookie,nook,Nicki,Nikki">nokia</span> mobile phone.  </div> <p charindex="540"> </p>  <p charindex="541">In just two days time, I became very comfortable at some of the design patterns. Not just theory but how and where those patterns are applied and best situations to apply those patterns. I listened to one more podcast on user experience. It looks like you will really get something out of it. </p>  <p charindex="834">The interviews are given by the experts in the .NET and business domain. So next time you do something different and somebody questions you, you could definitely say that Scott Guthrie advises to use typed <span class="misspell" charindex="1040" suggestions="data sets,data-sets,detests,dadaists,distastes">datasets</span>  or  something. </p>  <p charindex="1064"> </p>  <p charindex="1065">so check out this site for more podcasts on .NET  technology . </p>  <p charindex="1127"><a href="http://polymorphicpodcast.com/" charindex="1127">http://polymorphicpodcast.com</a>   </p>
