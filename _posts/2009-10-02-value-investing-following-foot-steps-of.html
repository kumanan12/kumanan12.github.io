<div align="justify">Besides my academic qualification in Finance (M.B.A) in India, I used to read lot of magazines and financial news papers. I learnt this from my old friend Mustafa in chennai, India. At that time, he was considered as the master of financial information. You ask him anything, he will give you instant answer(of course the correct one). Since I came from an engineering background, getting a grasp of those concepts was quite a task for me. Slowly I started getting interest in finance. </div><p align="justify"><br /></p><div align="justify">Then my financial reading fell off the cliff as I had to learn software to get a job in software industry. After I came to US as a software engineer in 2000, I had both money and little bit financial knowledge. I started investing in finance at the peak of the market. NASDAQ reached its highest 5000 mark in April. Luckily I was reading this this book "<br />24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success" . It said </div><ol><li><div align="justify">Do not have emotional attachment to any stock.</div></li><li><div align="justify">If the price of any stock goes down by 8% in your portfolio, simply sell it</div></li></ol><p align="justify">I don't remember any of the other steps.I simply sold all the stocks that I had as all of them met those criteria. In the end I got a $700 loss. I only bought well known companies like oracle,cisco,coco cola,nokia,sun micro systems.</p><p align="justify">The mistake I made was</p><p align="justify">I did not really do any fundamental analysis. The companies are still great companies but are the price of the stock worth the value?</p><p align="justify">The price of the stock was so high when compared to the earnings. Since every company was having the same trend. I simply overlooked.</p><p align="justify">Now I just finished reading an excellent book "<span style="font-size:130%;color:#ff9966;"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Value-Investing/dp/0470139080/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1254525819&amp;sr=1-1">Getting started in Value Investing</a></strong></span>". That book deserves a 5 star rating. </p><p align="justify">I believe everybody should read that book if they want to invest in stocks.</p><p align="justify">You dont need to have a Phd in finance to invest in stock market. </p><p align="justify">I know many of my friends simply invest in stocks with no reasoning on why they are buying that particular stock.</p><p align="justify">After reading that book, I have disciplined myself in investing stocks. I am going to sincerely follow the investment principles of Mr Buffet.</p><ol><li><div align="justify">Pay all your debt </div></li><li><div align="justify">You have to be patient </div></li><li><div align="justify">Invest the money that you don't need for the next five years</div></li><li><div align="justify">Do not put all eggs in one basket. Diversify Diversify Diversify</div></li><li><div align="justify">Invest in well known companies and huge companies(>10 billion)</div></li><li><div align="justify">Analyse their fundamentals( P/E, EPS, Operating margin, consistent dividends, rich in cash reserves and less debt, consistent increase in earnings, return on shareholder equity, ).</div></li></ol><p align="justify">Compare this with the industry that they belong to and with their competitors. </p><p align="justify">If you ask me how you can know what all these ratios and how to intrepret them buy the book that I mentioned in this post. </p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">Here is my portfolio and I am going to wait for 5 years. Lets see what happens.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify"></p><!-- Start of Yahoo!
